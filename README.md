# dpcrk (Dokter's PIN cracker)

Ever walked passed a door with a keypad and noticed you can see four worn buttons? Then being too lazy to try to figure out the different combinations?

Fear no more, just use this script.

You tell it if it has a number series between 1-9 or 0-9, then how many digits the PIN have and it will first display the amount of possible combinations.

If you think you know some of the digits you can add that later on of you decide to view possible combinations. You can also add the first digits, if you truly know them.

*Only use it if you have forgotten your PIN or have been allowed to attempt to guess a PIN.*

### Roadmap

* Tweak the code so the TUI looks better and that it works better.
